## This file contains answers to exercises that did not require the specific creation of a ruby file

### Exercise 2:
What do the following expressions evaluate to?

1. x = 2
	- 2
2. puts x = 2
	- nil
3. p name = "Joe"
	- 'Joe'
4. four = "four"
	- 'four'
5. print something = "nothing"
	- nil

### Exercise 4:
Nothing, because the return statement is encountered before the puts statement.

### Exercise 5:
In order to get it to print, remove the return statement. However, this code, while now printing to the screen, will still return nil because puts is the last statement of the method and puts returns nil.

### Exercise 6:
The user tried to execute the method 'calculate_product' but only specified 1 argument instead of the required 2.
