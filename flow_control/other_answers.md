## This file contains answers to exercises that did not require the specific creation of a ruby file

### Exercise 1:

1. (32 * 4) >= 129
	- false
2. false != !true
	- false
3. true == 4
	- false
4. false == (847 == '874')
	- true
5. (!true || (!(100 / 5) == 20) || ((328 / 4) == 82)) || false
	- true

### Exercise 4:

1. "FALSE"
2. "Did you get it right?"
3. "Alright now!"

### Exercise 6:
There is a missing 'end' statement to end the if-statement. The 'end' that is currently provided is (based on the indent) for the end of the method. There should be 2 'end's total. To fix the issue, add a line with the word 'end' after the line puts "nope"
