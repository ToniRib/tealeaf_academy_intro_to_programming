### Exercise 5:
For the first section of code, x will be printed as 3 and there is no error. The times block simply modifies the value of x, which is available outside of the scope of the do/end block. For the second section of code, there will be an error because x is not available outside of the scope of the times do/end block since it was created within it.

### Exercise 6:
In the irb session, the user tried to either invoke the method 'shoes' on an Object or use a variable named 'shoes' but neither of these exist within the scope of the current program.
