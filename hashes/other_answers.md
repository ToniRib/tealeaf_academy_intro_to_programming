## This file contains answers to exercises that did not require the specific creation of a ruby file

### Exercise 4:
person[:name]

### Exercise 7:
x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

The first hash uses the symbol 'x' as the key. The second hash uses the string value 'hi there' (aka the value of the variable x) as the key.

### Exercise 8:
The array likely means that someone tried to use the .keys method on an array object instead of a hash object, so the answer is B.
